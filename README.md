<b>For who is this app?</b>
Basically anyone who actually cares about their privacy and security and is just fed up with all the hacks, eavesdropping and censorship. You can use this app to send and receive encrypted RSA 4096 voice, text, messages and pictures that are created on the fly. DigiSafeGuard app is part of the Securypto Blockchain project. This is perfect for you if you want to send and receive sensitive data, store personal and private messages on your phone, whistleblowers and journalists and anyone in between that cares about their data. And not to forget the air-gapped based encrypted cryptocurrency wallet, also known as Hardware Wallet. Basically all you need to protect your funds and data in one single secure app.


<b>Several features of the app:</b>
Encrypted voice memoâ€™s:
Send and receive military grade encrypted voice memoâ€™s which only you and the receiver can play. Even if the encrypted message is forwarded to an third party, they wonâ€™t be able to play it as it is ONLY intended for the by you selected receiver only.


<b>Secure image sharing:</b>
Forget apps with fake sense of security where your image is still stored somewhere on the phone having only the extentions changed. Take a picture inside the app and encrypt it immediately from the memory and send it to the designated receiver. The receiver and only the receiver can open it. It would be useless to send or forward the encrypted message to someone else.


<b>Anonymous Messaging:</b>
You will talk completely anonymously. Being impossible to be identified or recognized. Received an important message and you want to save it? Just choose a title for it, encrypt and save it to your archives and access it anytime you want when opening off course your secure vault.


<b>Password vault:</b>
Type and encrypt your passwords on the go, either in 1 vault or multiple passwords in different vaults.


<b>Unlimited amount of vaults:</b>
1 vault for your passwords, another one for your crypto keys and then another one for storing encrypted images of confidential files (stop making pictures of your ID and saving them on your SD card, you are asking for identity theft!). 


<b>Protect your data:</b>
Ever wanted to just save a piece of text and you end up taking a picture from it or worse save it in your memo (really??â€¦ how bad are you looking to get hacked?). Just type whatever you like and save it in your secure encrypted archive. This is VERY handy for journalists, whistleblowers and anyone who wants to type and save on the fly in an encrypted environment. 


<b>Insurance:</b>
4096 RSA encryption on the fly makes it impossible to break ( if you can, you can claim 10 bitcoins as part of our bounty!) 


<b>Simple and Lightweight:</b>
Weâ€™ve developed an application to make it as simple and light as possible. No fancy and intrusive functions. 


<b>Global:</b>
The application is constantly updated with new languages and available worldwide for users. Take back control over your privacy no matter where you are.


<b>Encrypted backups:</b>
Create universal encrypted backups from your data and transfer it to another (offline)device, so even if your phone breaks, your data is always safe!
